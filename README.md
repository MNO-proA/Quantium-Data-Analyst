# Quantium Virtual Internship Project: Driving Chip Category Growth Through Data Analysis

## Project Overview

As a Data Analyst intern at Quantium, I undertook a project focused on optimizing the chip category for a supermarket client. The project was divided into two key challenges aimed at decoding customer behavior and evaluating the impact of new store layouts. The analysis provided actionable insights to enhance the supermarket's strategic planning for the chip category.

## Challenge 1: Decoding Customer Behavior in the Chip Aisle

### Primary Objective

To analyze customer transaction data to better understand the purchasing behavior of customers who buy chips, identifying key customer segments, understanding sales drivers, and providing actionable insights to support strategic planning for the chip category over the next six months.

### Problem Statement

The client, a Category Manager for Chips, aims to understand the types of customers purchasing chips and their behavior within a specific region. This understanding will help in optimizing product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.

### Methodology

- **Data Exploration**: I conducted an initial exploration of the customer transaction data to identify relevant features for analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Using demographic and purchasing data, I segmented customers based on their buying habits and demographic profiles.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed price sensitivity analysis across customer segments to identify differences in behavior and spending patterns.

### Key Findings

- **High-Value Segment**: Mainstream Young Singles/Couples emerged as a high-value segment, with higher spending per unit and a preference for premium brands like Tyrrells.
- **Price Sensitivity**: Statistically significant differences in price sensitivity were observed between customer segments, informing targeted pricing strategies.

## Challenge 2: Evaluating the Impact of New Store Layouts

### Primary Objective

To assess the effectiveness of new store layouts trialed in selected stores (Stores 77, 86, and 88) by comparing their sales performance against control stores. The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations on whether to roll out the new layouts to all stores based on their impact on key sales metrics.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge was to determine whether the new store layouts significantly improved sales performance compared to control stores. This required selecting appropriate control stores, developing a robust comparison methodology, and analyzing the significance of changes in sales metrics during the trial period.

### Methodology

- **Control Store Selection**: Carefully selected control stores that matched the trial stores in terms of size, location, and customer demographics.
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Compared sales performance metrics (e.g., total sales, customer numbers) between trial and control stores.
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Used statistical tests to determine if observed changes in sales metrics were significant.

### Key Findings

- **Positive Impact**: Two out of three trial stores showed statistically significant increases in both sales and customer numbers, demonstrating the positive impact of the new layouts.
- **Recommendations**: Provided data-driven recommendations for further rollout, emphasizing the importance of continued monitoring and potential refinements.

## Impact and Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Actionable Insights**: Delivered insights that directly informed the client's strategy for the chip category, contributing to optimized product offerings and marketing strategies.
- **Technical Proficiency**:Showcased proficiency in data manipulation, data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn), statistical analysis (Hypothesis Testing) using Python (SciPy).
- **Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**: Demonstrated strong analytical skills by translating complex data into clear, actionable business recommendations.
